# Sentiment Analysis Using Transformers and LSTM

This project applies sentiment analysis techniques on textual data using both Transformer-based models (e.g., DistilBERT) and traditional LSTM networks. The goal is to classify text into sentiment categories such as **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative**.
